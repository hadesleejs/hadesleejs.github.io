# Iptables args

* -j RETURN : will cause the current packet top stop traveling throught the chain(or sub-chain)
* -j ACCEPT : the rule is accepted and will not continue traversing the current chain or any other ones in the same table.Note however,that a packet was accepted in one chain might still travel through chains within other tables,and could still be dropped there.
* -j DNAT   : only available within PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains in the nat table,and any of the chains called upon from any of those listed chains.
* -j SNAT   : valid only in nat tables,within the POSTROUTING chain.
* -j REJECT : sends a response back(unlike drop).valid in the INPUT,FORWARD and OUTPUT chains or their sub chains 
* -j DROP   : drops the packet,right there right then
* -j MARK   : only valid in managle table. Note that the mark value is not set within the actual package,but is a value that is associated within the kernel with the packet. In other words does not make it out of the machineiptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -j MARK --set-mark 2
* -j MASQUERADE
            : similar to SNAT but used on a outbound network interface when the outbound IP can change. Say a DHCP interface only valid within the POSTROUTING
* -j REDIRECT
            : redirect packets and streams to the machine itself. Valid within the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains of the nat tables. It is also valid within user-defined chains that are only called from those chains.

**Code:** Let's keep it to its length and let it not take the whole width.

```html
<div class="nav">

        <li>About</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
        <li>Project</li>
